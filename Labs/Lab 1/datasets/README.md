### CIFAR-10 Data Loading

We will now train the implemented neural network in a real dataset, the widely used CIFAR-10. You can download this dataset at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz Then, you can put it in the folder malcom/datasets (or anywhere else you want, but then you will need to change the path in the below code).

Note: The files are not uploaded to github :x:

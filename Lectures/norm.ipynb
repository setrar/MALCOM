    "The term \"norm 2\" typically refers to the **Euclidean norm**, which is also known as the **L2 norm**. It is one of the most commonly used types of vector norms in mathematics, particularly in fields such as linear algebra, machine learning, and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of the L2 Norm\n",
    "The L2 norm of a vector $ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $ is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\ldots + x_n^2}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties of the L2 Norm\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance**: The L2 norm measures the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point represented by the vector in $ n $-dimensional space. It is the direct generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to multiple dimensions.\n",
    "- **Non-negativity**: $ \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 \\geq 0 $, and $ \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 = 0 $ if and only if $ \\mathbf{x} = 0 $.\n",
    "- **Triangle Inequality**: For any two vectors $ \\mathbf{u} $ and $ \\mathbf{v} $ in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $, the L2 norm satisfies the triangle inequality:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  \\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|_2 \\leq \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2 + \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- **Scaling**: For any scalar $ a $ and vector $ \\mathbf{x} $, $ \\|a\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 = |a| \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: The L2 norm is used in regularization techniques (like Ridge regression, or L2 regularization) to control the complexity of the model by penalizing the sum of the squares of the model parameters, thus helping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Statistics**: It is used to calculate the standard Euclidean distance between points in space, which is crucial for methods like K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
    "- **Engineering**: In signal processing, the L2 norm (or energy norm) of a signal is used to measure its total energy.\n",

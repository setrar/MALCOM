    "To ensure that the production cost of MLC1.0 is less than the production cost of MLC2.0, the number of hours $ H $ spent on validation must be greater than 0. Therefore, any positive number of hours spent on validation will satisfy this condition. Since the question implicitly assumes H to be non-zero for a meaningful comparison, we can conclude that $ H $ must be greater than 0."
